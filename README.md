# 📊 Employee Attrition & Retention Analysis

Understanding why employees leave a company is crucial for improving retention and building a healthier workplace. In this project, I dive deep into a real HR dataset to uncover patterns behind employee attrition using both **Excel dashboards** and **SQL analysis**.

## 🧠 The Story Behind the Project

Imagine you're a data analyst at a mid-sized company. Your manager approaches you with a concern: **"We're losing too many employees — can you find out why?"**

That question became the starting point of this project.

To answer it, I:
- Built a dynamic **Excel dashboard** to let stakeholders explore attrition metrics interactively
- Ran detailed **SQL queries** to uncover which factors most strongly correlate with employees leaving

## 🔍 Key Questions I Answered

- Which departments and job roles have the highest attrition rates?
- Does job satisfaction play a role in employee turnover?
- Are younger employees more likely to leave?
- How does overtime or income level affect attrition?
- What patterns can be seen across education levels and tenure?




### 📌 From SQL Analysis:
- **Departments with highest attrition**: Sales and Human Resources
- **Job role with the highest attrition**: Sales Representative
- **Age group with highest attrition**: 18–25 years
- **Education groups most at risk**: Below College and College
- **Job Satisfaction**: Lower satisfaction directly correlates with higher attrition
- **Overtime impact**: Employees who work overtime are **3x more likely** to leave
- **Salary trend**: Lower monthly income is strongly linked to higher attrition

### 📌 From Excel Dashboard:
- **Total employees**: 1,470
- **Employees who left**: 237 → **16.1% attrition rate**
- **Average monthly salary**: $6,503
- **Average job satisfaction**: 2.7 out of 4
- **Tenure insight**: Highest attrition among employees who:
  - Stayed **over 30 years** (likely retirement)
  - Stayed **less than 10 years** (main focus for HR retention strategy)
