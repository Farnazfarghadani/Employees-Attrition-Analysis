# 📊 Employee Attrition & Retention Analysis

Understanding why employees leave a company is crucial for improving retention and building a healthier workplace. In this project, I dive deep into a real HR dataset to uncover patterns behind employee attrition using both **Excel dashboards** and **SQL analysis**.

## 🧠 The Story Behind the Project

Imagine you're a data analyst at a mid-sized company. Your manager approaches you with a concern: **"We're losing too many employees — can you find out why?"**

That question became the starting point of this project.

To answer it, I:
- Built a dynamic **Excel dashboard** to let stakeholders explore attrition metrics interactively
- Ran detailed **SQL queries** to uncover which factors most strongly correlate with employees leaving
